The wandb report link is: 

**Part 1**
1. Question 1
    1. Here we have created a class CNN, which will return a model based on different parameters,which are passed. 
    2. We have made a model and trained it on some random parameters, to check wheteher everything is in working or not

2. Question 2
    1. In this question, we have setup the sweep on the above code.
    2. Then we have run the sweep in wandb.

3. Question 4
    1. Here we have run the model on the parameters, on which we are getting highest accuracy
    2. Then we have taken 30 images and plotted the images with their predicted label in wandb, which is added to the report.
    3. Then we have........................

 4. Question 5
    1. Here we have implemented guided backpropagation.
    2. We have added the images to the report.

**Part B**
 1. Question 3
    1. In this question we have setup the sweep using different pretrained model as hyperparameter.
    2. We have added all the losses and accuracies plot in the report.
